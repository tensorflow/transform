# Examples for TensorFlow Transform

## Simple Example
See [getting started guide](../getting_started.md).

## Census Example
The "Census Income" dataset is provided by the [UCI Machine Learning
Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). This dataset
contains both categorical and numeric data. See the [getting started guide](../getting_started.md) for more details.  For information on running the
example, see the [Downloading the Census dataset](../getting_started.md#downloading-the-census-dataset) section.

## Sentiment Analysis Example

This example is similar to the `census_example.py` example but there are some
differences. More extensive Beam processing is required before tf.Transform is
invoked. See the [sentiment example guide](sentiment_example.md#sentiment-analysis) for more information.
