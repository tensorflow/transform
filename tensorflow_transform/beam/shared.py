"""Shared class.

Shared class for managing a single instance of an object shared by multiple
threads within the same process.

Example usage:
  class RainbowTableLookupFn(beam.DoFn):
    def __init__(self, shared_handle):
      self._shared_handle = shared_handle

    def process(self, element, table_elements):
      def construct_table():
        # Construct the rainbow table from the table elements.
        # The table contains lines in the form "string::hash"
        result = dict()
        for line in table_elements.splitlines():
          parts = line.split('::')
          result[parts[1]] = parts[0]
        return result

      rainbow_table = self._shared_handle.acquire(construct_table)
      unhashed_str = rainbow_table.get(element)
      if unhashed_str is not None:
        yield unhashed_str

  shared_handle = Shared()
  p = beam.Pipeline()
  table = p | 'Read table' >> beam.io.ReadFromText(table_path)
  unhashed = (p
              | 'Read hashes' >> beam.io.ReadFromText(hashes_path)
              | 'Unhash' >> beam.ParDo(
                   RainbowTableLookupFn(shared_handle), table)

class _SharedMap(object):
  """Map for storing objects pointed to by Shared.

  The behaviour of SharedMap is as follows: when acquire is called, if the
  Shared object has already been initialised, we return the already-initialised
  copy. If not, we call the constructor_fn to construct it, and store it in
  the cache.

  One big caveat is this: we want to support cases where there is some delay
  between reacquistion of Shared objects, i.e. there may be a short period of
  time in which there are no references to the object before it is reacquired.

  This happens in various Beam runners (e.g. Dataflow runner): if we use a
  single thread for doing predictions with a large model, when the thread
  finishes its workitem, it will release the reference to the model. Since
  there's only a single thread, the model will have zero references to it
  and will be garbage collected. Shortly after this, the process receives a new
  workitem, creates a new thread, and attempts to reacquire the model. If we
  don't keep the model alive in between, the new thread will have to
  reinitialise the model from scratch.

  As such, we need to do some extra work to manage cached objects' lifetime.
  Ideally we would want to release the shared objects once the stage is
  complete, but we don't have information about that. As such, we work around
  this limitation as follows: when an object is first initialised, we create and
  maintain an explicit reference to it. This means that it will always have one
  reference to it from within _SharedMap.

  When acquire is called for a *different* object, we delete explicit references
  to *all other objects*. This means that if there are no external references to
  these objects, they will be garbage collected.

  This has the following implications:
  *  A shared object won't be GC'ed if there isn't another acquire called for
     a different shared object. This is okay for our use-cases. This means
     that the shared object will be kept alive for all stages fused with the
     stage that works with the shared object. However, all these stages would
     be allocated the same memory anyway, even if the shared object
     were released after the stage that uses it was done with it.
  *  Each stage can only use exactly one Shared token, otherwise only one
     Shared token, *NOT NECESSARILY THE LATEST*, will be "kept-alive" (using
     multiple shared tokens per-stage won't affect correctness, but will have
     no performance benefit either)
  *  If there are two different stages using separate Shared tokens, but which
     get fused together, only one Shared token will be "kept-alive". This
     effectively means that the Shared tokens do nothing: since S2 displaces S1,
     and after S2 executes a new thread is created starting with S1 again, which
     displaces S2.
