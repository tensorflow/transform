"""Functions that involve a full pass over the dataset.

This module contains functions that are used in the preprocessing function, to
define a full pass operation such as computing the sum, min, max or unique
values of a tensor over the entire dataset.  This is implemented by a reduction
operation in the Beam implementation.

From the user's point of view, an analyzer appears as a regular TensorFlow
function, i.e. it accepts and returns tensors.  However it is represented in
the graph as a `Analyzer` which is not a TensorFlow op, but a placeholder for
the computation that takes place outside of TensorFlow.

# NOTE: this code is designed so that Analyzer is pickleable, and in particular

# This is due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-3812.  Until that
# issue is fixed, anything that is a member variable of a Beam PTransform may
# end up getting pickled.  Instances of Analyzer do end up as member variables
# of a PTransform in our implementation of tf.Transform on Beam currently, so
# we must avoid directly putting `Tensor`s inside `Analyzer`, and instead use
# tensor names.
#
# Due to these pickling issues and also logical separation of TensorFlow and
# numpy code, the spec should also not contain TensorFlow dtypes but rather
# their numpy equivalent.
class Analyzer(object):

  An Analyzer is like a tf.Operation except that it requires computation over
  the full dataset.  E.g. sum(my_tensor) will compute the sum of the value of
  my_tensor over all instances in the dataset.  The Analyzer class contains the
  inputs to this computation, and placeholders which will later be converted to
  constants during a call to AnalyzeDataset.

  Analyzer implementations write some files to disk in a temporary location and
  return tensors that contain the filename.  These outputs must be added to the
  tf.GraphKeys.ASSET_FILEPATHS collection.  Doing so will ensure a few things
  happen:
  * the tensor will be removed from the collection prior to writing the
    SavedModel (since the tensor will be replaced)
  * when the tensor is replaced, the replacement will be added to the
    tf.GraphKeys.ASSET_FILEPATHS colleciton
  * This in turn causes the underlying file to be added to the SavedModel's
    `assets` directory when the model is saved

  Computes The unique values taken by `x`, which can be a `Tensor` or

  In case one of the tokens contains the '\n' or '\r' characters or is empty it
  will be discarded since we are currently writing the vocabularies as text
  files. This behavior will likely be fixed/improved in the future.

  quantile boundaries are computed using approximate quantiles,
  and error tolerance is specified using `epsilon`. The boundaries divide the
  input tensor into approximately equal `num_buckets` parts.
  See go/squawd for details, and how to control the error due to approximation.

  Args:
    x: An input `Tensor`.
    num_buckets: Values in the `x` are divided into approximately
      equal-sized buckets, where the number of buckets is num_buckets.
      This is a hint. The actual number of buckets computed can be
      less or more than the requested number. Use the generated metadata to
      find the computed number of buckets.
    epsilon: Error tolerance, typically a small fraction close to zero
      (e.g. 0.01). Higher values of epsilon increase the quantile approximation,
      and hence result in more unequal buckets, but could improve performance,
      and resource consumption.  Some measured results on memory consumption:
      For epsilon = 0.001, the amount of memory for each buffer to hold the
      summary for 1 trillion input values is ~25000 bytes. If epsilon is
      relaxed to 0.01, the buffer size drops to ~2000 bytes for the same input
      size. If we use a strict epsilon value of 0, the buffer size is same size
      as the input, because the intermediate stages have to remember every input
      and the quantile boundaries can be found only after an equivalent to a
      full sorting of input. The buffer size also determines the amount of work
      in the different stages of the beam pipeline, in general, larger epsilon
      results in fewer and smaller stages, and less time. For more performance
      trade-offs see also http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~weiwang/paper/SSDBM07_2.pdf

  """Computes pca on the dataset using biased covariance.

  The pca analyzer computes output_dim orthonormal vectors that capture
  directions/axes corresponding to the highest variances in the input vectors of
  x. The output vectors are returned as a rank-2 tensor with shape
  (input_dim, output_dim), where the 0th dimension are the components of each
  output vector, and the 1st dimension are the output vectors representing
  orthogonal directions in the input space, sorted in order of decreasing
  variances.

  The output rank-2 tensor (matrix) serves a useful transform purpose. Formally,
  the matrix can be used downstream in the transform step by multiplying it to
  the input tensor x. This transform reduces the dimension of input vectors to
  output_dim in a way that retains the maximal variance.

  NOTE: To properly use PCA, input vector components should be converted to
  similar units of measurement such that the vectors represent a Euclidean
  space. If no such conversion is available (e.g. one element represents time,
  another element distance), the canonical approach is to first apply a
  transformation to the input data to normalize numerical variances, i.e.
  tft.scale_to_z_score(). Normalization allows PCA to choose output axes that
  help decorrelate input axes.

  Below are a couple intuitive examples of PCA.

  Consider a simple 2-dimensional example:

  Input x is a series of vectors [e, e] where e is Gaussian with mean 0,
  variance 1. The two components are perfectly correlated, and the resulting
  covariance matrix is
  [[1 1],
   [1 1]].
  Applying PCA with output_dim = 1 would discover the first principal component
  [1 / sqrt(2), 1 / sqrt(2)]. When multipled to the original example, each
  vector [e, e] would be mapped to a scalar sqrt(2) * e. The second principal
  component would be [-1 / sqrt(2), 1 / sqrt(2)] and would map [e, e] to 0,
  which indicates that the second component captures no variance at all. This
  agrees with our intuition since we know that the two axes in the input are
  perfectly correlated and can be fully explained by a single scalar e.

  Consider a 3-dimensional example:

  Input x is a series of vectors [a, a, b], where a is a zero-mean, unit
  variance Gaussian. b is a zero-mean, variance 4 Gaussian and is independent of
  a. The first principal component of the unnormalized vector would be [0, 0, 1]
  since b has a much larger variance than any linear combination of the first
  two components. This would map [a, a, b] onto b, asserting that the axis with
  highest energy is the third component. While this may be the desired
  output if a and b correspond to the same units, it is not statistically
  desireable when the units are irreconciliable. In such a case, one should
  first normalize each component to unit variance first, i.e. b := b / 2.
  The first principal component of a normalized vector would yield
  [1 / sqrt(2), 1 / sqrt(2), 0], and would map [a, a, b] to sqrt(2) * a. The
  second component would be [0, 0, 1] and map [a, a, b] to b. As can be seen,
  the benefit of normalization is that PCA would capture highly correlated
  components first and collapse them into a lower dimension.
