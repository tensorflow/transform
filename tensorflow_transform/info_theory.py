  """Calculates the partial expected mutual information (EMI) of two variables.

    EMI reflects the MI expected by chance, and is used to compute adjusted
    mutual information. See www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjusted_mutual_information.

    The EMI for two variables x and y, is the sum of the expected mutual info
    for each value of x with each value of y. This function computes the EMI
    for a single value of each variable (x_i, y_j) and is thus considered a
    partial EMI calculation.

    Specifically:
    EMI(x, y) = sum_{n_ij = max(0, x_i + y_j - n) to min(x_i, y_j)} (
      n_ij / n * log2((n * n_ij / (x_i * y_j))
      * ((x_i! * y_j! * (n - x_i)! * (n - y_j)!) /
      (n! * n_ij! * (x_i - n_ij)! * (y_j - n_ij)! * (n - x_i - y_j + n_ij)!)))
    where n_ij is the joint count of x taking on value i and y taking on
    value j, x_i is the count for x taking on value i, y_j is the count for y
    taking on value j, and n represents total count.

  Args:
    n: The sum of weights for all values.
    x_i: The sum of weights for the first variable taking on value i
    y_j: The sum of weights for the second variable taking on value j

  Returns:
    Calculated expected mutual information for x_i, y_j.

  for a particular pair of values x_i, y_j (the caller is expected to divide
  the summation by n to compute the final mutual information result).
