# tf.Transform [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/tensorflow-transform.svg?style=plastic)](https://github.com/tensorflow/transform)

**tf.Transform** is a library for doing data preprocessing with
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org). It allows users to combine various
data processing frameworks (currently [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) is
supported but tf.Transform can be extended to support other frameworks),
with TensorFlow, to transform data. Because tf.Transform is built on TensorFlow,
it allows users to export a graph which re-creates the transformations they did
to their data as a TensorFlow graph. This is important as the user can then
incorporate the exported TensorFlow graph into their serving model, thus
avoiding skew between the served model and the training data.

# tf.Transform Samples

You can take a look at our tf.Transform samples on [Cloud ML Engine Github](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples#cpu-and-gpu) specifically [Criteo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/tree/master/criteo_tft), [Reddit](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/tree/master/reddit_tft) and [Movielens](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloudml-samples/tree/master/movielens).

**tf.Transform may introduce backwards incompatible changes before version
1.0**.

## Background

While TensorFlow allows users to do arbitrary manipulations on a single instance
or batch of instances, some kinds of preprocessing require a full pass over the
dataset. For example, normalizing an input value, computing a vocabulary for a
string input (and then mapping the string to an int with this vocabulary), or
bucketizing an input. While some of these operations can be done with TensorFlow
in a streaming manner (e.g. calculating a running mean for normalization), in
general it may be preferable or necessary to calculate these with a full pass
over the data.

## Installation and Dependencies

The easiest and recommended way to install tf.Transform is with the PyPI
package.

`pip install tensorflow-transform`

Currently tf.Transform requires that TensorFlow be installed but does not have
an explicit dependency on TensorFlow as a package. See [TensorFlow
documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) for more information on
installing TensorFlow.

tf.Transform does though have a dependency on the GCP distribution of Apache
Beam. Apache Beam is the framework used to run distributed pipelines. Apache
Beam is able to run pipelines in multiple ways, depending on the "runner" used,
and the "runner" is usually provided by a distribution of Apache
Beam. With the GCP distribution of Apache Beam, one can run Apache Beam
pipelines locally, or on
[Google Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/).

### Compatible Versions

This is a table of versions known to be compatible with each other.  This is not
a comprehensive list, meaning other combinations may also work, but these are
the combinations tested by our testing framework and by the team before
releasing a new version.
